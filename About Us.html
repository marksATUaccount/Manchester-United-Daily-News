    <h2 style="color:white">Our Story</h2>
    <p style="color:white;">We creted Manchester United Daily News when we were watching a match one day and the broadcasters that were covering the game did not have a post game interview or analysis. We realised that not all tv channels have this privilag, and so decided to make a website that goes into detail about all things Man Utd for people that have found themselves in a similar situation. We want all football fans to have unlimited access to all things Man Utd.</p>
    <br>
